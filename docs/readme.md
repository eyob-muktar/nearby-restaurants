Things to improve

Client

- Map view feels a little jumpy because it's updating on every center location and radius change. So check the change amount and fetch only a certain amount is changed
- List view doesn't scroll to the clicked place when the click is happening on the marker

Server

- Add additional fields in restaurant model (tags, ratings, price ranges)
- Change opening_hours field from string to json so that filtering can be done
